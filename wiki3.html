Before starting using the `esd` package, we highly recommend you to go through the [esd.pdf](ftp://ftp.met.no/users/rasmusb/esd.pdf) help file containing a full description of all functions including few examples. In case that you are not able to download the help file, you can easily generate it using the following command

`$ R CMD Rd2pdf esd`
