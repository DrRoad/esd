Welcome to the esd wiki!

The **esd** R package or library is made freely available by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute ([MET Norway](www.met.no)) and is for use by the climate community. It was primarily built for statistical downscaling of climate variables and parameters form global climate models (e.g. ENSEMBLEs, CMIP3/5 model results), and has recently been extended to deal with data I/O (e.g. global climate datasets), statistical analysis, and visualization.

It consists in i) retrieving and manipulating large samples of climate and model data from various sources, ii) computing Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Multi-Variate Regressions (MVRs) using very simple R commands and procedures (See Examples).

The **esd** library has been built with the emphasis of traceability, compatibility, and transparency of the data, methods, procedures, and results. 

As the library has been built on R system, it inherits from the large number of R built-in functions and procedures.

* [Some recommendations before starting using the library.](https://github.com/abdelkaderm/esd-git/wiki/1.-Before-starting)

The **esd** library can be easily tailored to various downscaling projects with few adaptations such as the few examples shown here. 

The main functionalities of the `esd` are 

### Data handling 
  * Formatted datasets (`data(package='esd')`)
  * Select weather station from meta data (stationmeta) based on a list of selection criteria (`select.station()`)
  * Retrieving data from observational weather stations included in the package (`station()`)
  * Retrieving field data from a netcdf file (`retrieve()`)
  * Regridding (`regrid()`)
  * Subsetting (`subset()`)
  * Aggregating - Spatial and temporal aggregation (`aggregate()`)

### Data processing
  * Empirical Orthogonal Functions for fields' objects (`EOF()`)
  * Principal component Analysis for stations' objects (`PCA()`) 

### Downscaling
  * Downscale an ensemble of stations (`DS()`)
  * Downscale an ensemble of stations from an ensemble of gcms (`DSE()`).

### Visualizations
  * Plots for esd objects (`plot()`)
  * Maps for esd objects (`map()`)
