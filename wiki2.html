Unfortunately, `esd` cannot be installed directly from the R-cran repository. So you need to do the installation manually. 
First, download the esd zipped file whcih corresponds to your operating system. Then, download the zipped file from the `esd` repository on your local machine, and finally, type the following to begin the installation 

on a linux shell, 

`$ R CMD INSTALL esd.tar.zip`

on R shell,  

`> install.packages("esd.tar.gz")`

A progress message is shown on the screen and a confirmation "DONE" is be displayed when the installation is completed.
